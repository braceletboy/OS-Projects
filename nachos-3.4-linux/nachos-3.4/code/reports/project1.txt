Exercise 1: Completed.
Use HW1_SEMAPHORES to test the final version.
Use HW1_MULTIPLE_THREADS to test the version with only the first change, which changes ThreadTest to fork n threads.

Exercise 2: Completed. Use HW1_LOCKS to compile. The lock is used as mutex lock for the variable SharedVariable instead of semaphore.

Exercise 3: Completed. Use HW1_CONDITIONS to complile. The condition variable is used to make the barrier instead of using semaphore.

Exercise 4: Completed. Use HW1_ELEVATOR to compile.

To run the program for each exercise, go to folder `threads` and use the command: ./nachos -q <number-of-threads-or-persons>
