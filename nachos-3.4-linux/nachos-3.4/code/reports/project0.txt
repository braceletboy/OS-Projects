a) Platform: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
   Experience: We faced two errors while compiling the code. The following are
   the errors
   1) fatal error: bits/libc-header-start.h: No such file or directory
   2) fatal error: bits/c++config.h: No such file or directory

   We solved these errors by installing gcc-multilib and g++-multilib using the
   apt package manager.

b) Experience: The first test gave the output as expected. The second test gave
               an output as follows - "Machine halting!". The third test put us
               in to debugging mode/single-step mode.

c) Thread class Description:
   This class represents a single thread of execution in nachos. It has five
   member variables:
   1) stackTop - Pointer to the top of the execution stack
   2) machineState - The state of the machine registers
   3) stack - Pointer to the bottom of the execution stack
   4) status - Status of the thread
   5) name - Name of the thread

   It has 8 public member functions - Fork, Yield, Sleep, Finish,
   CheckOverflow, setStatus, getName, Print. One private member function -
   StackAllocate. 

   Finally, if a user program is running an additional state is tracked for the
   user mode with the variable userRegisters. It also has a variable 'space'
   pointing to the user code. It also has two more public functions to save and
   restore user state.
